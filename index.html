<h3>about</h3>
</div>

Alexander Evans teaches college writing by day, and at night, he writes flash fiction. His stories have been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and been featured in magazines such as Pithead Chapel, X-R-A-Y, and Milk Candy Review. He spends much of his time talking to his rescue pup, Otis, and trying to remember where he set down his cup of tea.

He is available for freelance writing and editing work; to start the conversation, just click the email link below.
